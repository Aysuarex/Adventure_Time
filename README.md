# ADVENTURE TIME 

## Introduction ðŸ‘€

A first-person maze-based adventure game with a captivating storyline about adventurers going on a world tour to amazing tourist attractions and landmaeks all over the world, across four continentswith each loction holding unforseen dangers of their own waiting for the unsuspecting adventurers.

## About The Game  

There are two Modes to choose from:
1. Story Mode (Recommended)
2. Quick Play


There are 4 different locations within the game:
1. Katanga Nation
1. Baluba Kingdom
1. Kalakuta Republic
1. Mallam's Palace

Each of these choices births a story of its own and they all have their own different challenges in form of mazes for the player to solve.

The Quick Play mode also features a fifth location option- "Random" in case you're into surprises or you're feeling lucky.

The game also features a (not-so-)hidden treasure chest within every maze.

## How To Play ðŸŽ®

Enter F, R, L, B or X (in uppercase) within the game to navigate Forward, Right, Left, go Back or Exit the maze, respectively.

A bird-eye view of the maze is displayed on the screen for the user. It serves as a satellite image (top elevation) of the maze and it is used for navigation within the maze.

Note: The satellite image does not display the appearance of the maze from what seems to be the Point-Of-View of the player, it is simply a zoom-out of the maze structure
